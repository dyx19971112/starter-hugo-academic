China implemented Tax-for-free in 2006, and this reform had a profound impact on China's agricultural production. However, due to China's vast territory and complex agricultural production factors, research on the effects and mechanisms of Tax-for-free has been controversial. 

This paper will select the input, output and tax data of 258 cities from 2001 to 2013, and study the impact of agricultural tax reform and input of various production factors on agricultural outputs by constructing breakpoint model and difference-in-difference model. 

The results of the study found that agricultural tax reform has improved agricultural input-output efficiency, and increased farmers' income and expenditure through direct reduction and exemption of agricultural taxes, and that agricultural tax reform has played a more significant role in promoting agricultural production in eastern and western cities with small populations and small output
