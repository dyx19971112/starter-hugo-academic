I worked as a full time research assisant in Institute of Big Data and Information Science, School of Economics and Management, USTB. 

My responsibility is referring to the paper “C-index: A weighted network node centrality measure for collaboration competence”, writted by professor Xiangbin Yan, constructed an collaboration index, and calculated the collaboration competence of scholars in the required list. Used web crawler and SQL to capture and processing data. The amount of data is about 150,000.

Based on the database, constructed an information system for the c-index established, responsible for the overall design and construction of the system.
