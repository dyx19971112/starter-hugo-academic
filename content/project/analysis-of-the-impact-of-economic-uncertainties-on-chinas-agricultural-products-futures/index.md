Under the combined influence of economic and policy factors, the pricing mechanism of agricultural futures is complicated. From the perspective of economic policy uncertainty, this paper analyses the non-linear and dynamic inherent fluctuation structure of the agricultural product futures price index. Eight economic uncertain factors are selected, and the time interval is from June 2007 to June 2019.

 We conducts an empirical study on the volatility of Nanhua agricultural products index by building MS-VAR. The result shows that the impact from economic uncertainties have significant regional conversion characteristics for agricultural futures indexes. The regional status can be divided into rising, oscillating, and declining phases, and there are different states of regional system transfer response. Among the selected economic uncertainties, China economic policy uncertainty, global economic policy uncertainty, international crude oil volatility, industrial growth rate, implied volatility index and have significant relationship between agricultural futures index under specific conditions. 

The research in this paper provides new ideas and research methods for explaining the price fluctuations of commodity futures using a non-linear econometric model.
