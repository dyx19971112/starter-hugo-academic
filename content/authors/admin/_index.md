Welcome! I am a Master's student at Olin business school, Wahington University in St. Louis, expecting to graduate in 5/2022. My major is business analytics, financial technology track. My current GPA is 3.8/4.0.


I am always keen on academic research. When I was in high school, Beijing No.35 high school, I attended a 1-year-long project with the Chinese Academy of Science, conducted research on botany statistics, and published the paper on Bulletin of Biology. During my undergraduate in USTB, I kept looking for research opportunities and improving myself, worked as RA for 3 projects. After graduation, I worked as a full-time RA in the Institute of Big Data and Information Science, USTB for one year. Then, I worked as TA and RA for Dr. Dan Zhao in Olin business school, WashU. To sum up, academic research plays an essential part in my life, and that is what I enjoy doing.


For the future, pursuing a Ph.D. degree and a career in academia would be my dream.
